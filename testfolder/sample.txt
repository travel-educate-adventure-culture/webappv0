I am creating a sample file here. 

All website folders can be pasted in /Github/webappv0 directory.

Any changes made to the files in /Github directory will be visible on the Github desktop directory. 

These changes will all go to the master branch as that is the current setting. 

A new branch can be created at any point, for a particular feature of the web application. This can later be merged into the master branch. 
(Currently let's not focus on that)

Just get comfortable using this tool.

Any change which happens to the file external to my system will cause the Github tool to refresh the changes automatically or you can choose 
to manually refresh by clicking Fetch origin.

Once satisfied with the changes, you can save the file.
